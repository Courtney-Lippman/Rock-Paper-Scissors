# Rock, Paper, Scissors

### Abstract:
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a web-based application that generates games of rock, paper, scissors. Using JavaScript in conjunction with CSS and HTML, I built Rock, Paper, Scissors to allow users to play the game against the computer. There are two variations of the game: classic and difficult. Classic has the typical fighters of rock, paper, and scissors. Difficult has rock, paper, scissors, alien, and lizard. The logic was written so that other variations of the fighters could be easily added. The user is able to pick from a list of fighters based on the variation of game that they choose, and the computer will randomly generate a choice from the same list. Once the fighters have been chosen, then a winner is determined, and the win is added to the winners winning tally. The win tallies are carried over to other games, including when the user switches to a different game variation. Note: The winning tallies will not persist across page refreshes.

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
This project was completed during my fifth week at Turing School of Software and Design. It was my second solo project and was a fantastic opportunity to showcase everything that I have learned in Module 1. I started from scratch and the project took me five days to complete. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/rock-paper-scissors-solo-v2.html).

### Learning Goals:
1. Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
3. Use my problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust myself to problem solve all logical challenges faced during the project

### Technology Used
- Atom
- HTML
- CSS
- Chrome Dev Tools
- JavaScript
- Github

### Wins:
- I found that my knowledge was solid for all the concepts that I came across while completing the project, which instilled confidence in my ability to quickly learn and apply new concepts.
- Being able to efficiently problem solve complex logic, made me realize how far I have come with my problem solving skills since starting the frontend program at Turing School of Software and Design.
- Even with a solo project, I was able to collaborate with peers through brain storming ideas around bug fixes, and offering to be a sounding board for others and their ideas.

### Challenges:
- At first, the code was repetitive, but after a considerable amount of refactoring, I am very proud for how clean the code is.
- Before going into the project, event delegation was a difficult concept for me. After, incorporating event delegation in the code on multiple occasions, I have solidified my knowledge about the concept.

### Future Features:
- Add local storage so that the win tallies are stored locally and persist upon page refresh
- Add more game variations including a variation in which the user can input their own fighters. The user will have the option to click a create your own game, which when clicked, the user is brought to a new page that has input fields. The input fields will be designed so that the player can input fighter details such as a name, and an image. Each fighter input will then be pushed into an array that will be used when the users created game variation is clicked.
- Add the ability for users to play against other users.
